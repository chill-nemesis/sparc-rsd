# Exercise 4

In this exercise, we are playing around with a magnetic micro-robot.


## Tasks
In `dipole.py`, try to implement the three missing functions `global_magnetization`, `magnetic_torque`, and `magnetic_force`. If you are stuck, have a look at the exercise slides on the maths behind them.

## Tips
This coding task should be relatively simple to complete (although it was not easy to develop...). Try to play around with the values of the magnetization, experiment with your B-field, the material properties, etc. Can you get the robot to follow a simple path?
